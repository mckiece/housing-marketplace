# Housing Marketplace

Website where users can browse housing options, create an account, and post their own listings in addition to contacting other users about their listings. A React app that uses Firebase for backend services, including user authentication, creating new listings in the database, uploading images, and uses the Google Maps geocoding API to verify addresses.
